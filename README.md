# The Ansible Cheat Sheet

## Installing Ansible

### On Linux

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
# On Red Hat-based systems (Fedora, CentOS)
sudo yum install ansible
```

Or use pip:

```bash
pip install ansible
```

Or use pipx:

```bash
pipx install ansible
```

### On macOS

Use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ansible
```

### On Windows

Ansible can be run from inside a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instance. First, ensure that WSL is installed, then install Ansible in the Linux distribution of your choice, following the Linux installation steps.

## Configuring Ansible

Default Ansible configuration settings can be overridden using environment variables. The same variables can be used to override settings in the `ansible.cfg` file in ini format. Typically, environment variables are in capital letters, while the corresponding configuration settings are in lowercase.

## Inventory

### Setting Up the Inventory File (INI)

```ini
[web]
192.168.1.2 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu

[db]
192.168.1.3 ansible_ssh_user=root
```

### Setting Up the Inventory File (YAML)

```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    192.168.1.2:
      ansible_ssh_user: ubuntu
    192.168.1.3:
      ansible_ssh_user: root
```

Replace the IP addresses and `ansible_ssh_user` with your server details.
